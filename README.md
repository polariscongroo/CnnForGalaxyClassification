### üéØ Objective
Develop a regression model (neural network : CNN) to predict the physical parameters of stars or exoplanets (e.g., radius, temperature, orbital period, density, etc.) based on light curves or observable parameters from TESS dataset.

### üìñ Abstract
The use of deep learning for automatically classifying candidate exoplanet transit signals has been previously explored by Shallue & Vanderburg (2018), who developed a convolutional neural network trained on Kepler data (see also Zucker & Giryes 2018 and Pearson et al. 2018 for applications of neural networks to simulated transit data). High-precision space telescopes provide a massive amount of data, allowing us to explore space. According to Megan Ansdell, co-author of [1], deep learning has proven to be efficient for exoplanet transit classification. Machine learning can identify exoplanets by analyzing telescope data, most of which rely on the transit phenomenon.

üöÄ **Here are some key missions:**  
NASA‚Äôs **Kepler** (2009‚Äì2018) ‚Äì Detected exoplanets using stellar transits.  
**K2** (2014‚Äì2018) ‚Äì Extension of Kepler with a different field of view.  
**TESS** (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, since 2018) ‚Äì Searches for exoplanets near their host stars, sector by sector.  
**CHEOPS** (Characterizing Exoplanets Satellite, since 2019) ‚Äì Studies exoplanets (size, density).  
**JWST** (James Webb Space Telescope, since 2021) ‚Äì Analyzes exoplanet atmospheres using infrared.  
**Hubble Space Telescope** (1990‚Äìpresent) ‚Äì Provides crucial observations of exoplanets.  
**PLATO** (Planetary Transits and Oscillations of Stars, expected 2026) ‚Äì Designed for high-precision exoplanet detection and habitability studies.  
While current missions focus on discovering new exoplanets, reducing false positives, and analyzing planetary composition, future missions will address habitability and high-precision detection methods.  

ü™ê **The Transit Phenomenon**  
The transit method is one of the most effective techniques for detecting exoplanets. It relies on observing a small, periodic dip in a star‚Äôs brightness caused by a planet passing in front of it.
Each transit event is characterized by:  
Period: The time between two consecutive transits.  
Epoch: The exact moment a transit is detected.  
Duration: The time during which the star's brightness decreases.  
However, not all transit signals correspond to exoplanets. Many false positives can arise due to :  
Eclipsing binary stars (EBs or BEBs - Background Eclipsing Binaries), where another star mimics a planetary transit.  
Instrumental noise or artifacts, which can create misleading signals.  

‚òÑÔ∏è **Motivation**  
TESS, launched in 2018, detects exoplanets by measuring transit signals in stellar flux using The Transit method. It records high-cadence observations of thousands of stars and full-frame images covering 75% of the sky. Machine learning, especially neural networks, helps efficiently filter and analyze this vast dataset.
**This project combines two rapidly evolving fields: exoplanet research in astronomy and deep learning in computer science. Training a deep neural network (CNN) that can adapt to future missions, such as PLATO (2026), will be a crucial step forward in the search for habitability.**

### üî£ Methodology

- #### **Scientific Exploration**
üî≠ Understanding the physical parameters available in catalogs (e.g., radius, mass, temperature, period, etc.).  
üîç Studying known relationships between these parameters (e.g., mass-radius, temperature-luminosity correlations).

- #### **Features and Targets**
**Available Data:**  

**Light Curve:** Flux over time.  
**Metadata:** Temperature, magnitude, quality, etc.  

**Standard CNN (Main Features):**  
**Input:** Light curve (time series transformed into an image or sequence).  

**Enhanced CNN (Additional Features):**  
**Input 1:** Light curve (image/sequence).  
**Input 2:** Selected useful metadata (numerical values like TEFF, TESSMAG, LOGG).

**Finally:**  
_Possible inputs:_ summarized/statistical light curve data, magnitude, color, temperature, log(g), etc.  
_Target variables:_ radius, mass, density, etc.
